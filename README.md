## Project Overview  
**VocalHub** is an **AI-powered voice dashboard** built entirely with **HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript**. It enables users to interact with the web interface using voice commands, offering a smart and seamless experience directly in the browser without a backend.  

The dashboard supports simple AI-inspired features such as weather info cards, calculators, GPS location, clocks, YouTube access, and basic music playback—all triggered by **spoken commands**.  

## Key Features  
- **Voice Commands** using the Web Speech API.  
- **Dynamic Dashboard Cards** for weather, clock, calculator, GPS, YouTube, and more.  
- **Music Playback** with toggle controls.  
- **Minimalist & Responsive UI** styled with TailwindCSS.  
- **Accessible & User-Friendly** design with ARIA labels.  

## Voice Commands Supported  
- `show weather` → Displays weather info.  
- `show calculator` → Opens a calculator.  
- `show gps` → Shows live GPS location.  
- `show clock` → Displays a real-time clock.  
- `show youtube` → Opens YouTube link.  
- `show time` → Alerts the current system time.  
- `play music` → Plays/pauses background music.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **CSS Framework:** TailwindCSS  
- **Icons:** FontAwesome  
- **Fonts:** Poppins (Google Fonts)

4. Make sure to allow **microphone access** for voice recognition features.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Integrate **TensorFlow.js** to perform simple AI inference (e.g., sentiment analysis, object detection).  
- Add **real-time weather API integration** instead of static data.  
- Multi-language voice support.  
- Smarter task management with speech-to-text notes.
